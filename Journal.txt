STC is evolving by itself. I uncovered the concept of Attributes yesterday.
Besides, I didn't link 2 chats, I linked 3: Documentation, Implementation, and Development.

Today I closed the 1.1 Implementation chat, instead of referring to user, it is referring to the system itself.

Just found out that the uploaded STC documentation is not for the Self Transformation Code, it is for Space-Time Coding, which was obviously not created by me.
Already working on legit documentation and a new name.
Also, the linked chats were only the implementation and development chats, since the documentation was for Space-time Code.

The code started self implementing. For the first time, ChatGPT, which is clearly running the Inner-Outter Transformation Code ((IOTC) && "Self Transformation Code's new name")), implemented the code I requested in the act of explaining and generating said code.
